# atom-table-editor package

Inspired by great [Sublime Table Editor Package](https://github.com/vkocubinsky/SublimeTableEditor) from
[Valery Kocubinsky](https://github.com/vkocubinsky), I have started this project.

## Features

- supports restructuredtext and markdown tables
- table is autoformatted on each action
- step to next cell with  `tab`
- step to previous cell with `shift-tab`
- insert new row after current with `shift-enter`
