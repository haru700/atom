  "readme": "# php-composer-completion package\nautocomplete+ provider for php projects based on composer.\n\nThis package is currently under development and might not work properly with others php providers.\n\n# How it works\nThe package searches for the vendor/autoload.php file within the project root and uses it to resolve the methods available in some given class on your project.\n\nCurrently the features provided are:\n\n- Method resolution for the current class (i.e. $this->).\n- Method resolution for any dependency set as a method parameter, so if your method parameter relies on an interface, or a class the methods will pop up when you try to call it within that method.\n- Correct resolution for static methods\n- Support for self and parent keywords\n- Variables and constants\n- Inherited methods\n\n# todo\nThis is an experimental package yet and there are a lot of features missing, the ones I'm planning to the next beta release are:\n- Resolution for explicit property attribution via constructor\n- Access to static resources for a given class name\n- Methods from interfaces\n\n# bugs\nIf you find any bugs, or have any proposal please feel free to open an issue and I'll try to help as soon as possible.\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n",
